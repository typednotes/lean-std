  Hale.Base.Compose — Functor/Applicative composition

  `Compose F G α` wraps `F (G α)`. The composition of two functors is a functor;
  the composition of two applicatives is an applicative.

namespace Data.Functor

/-- Functor/applicative composition: $(\text{Compose}\;F\;G)\;\alpha = F\,(G\;\alpha)$.

    This witnesses the classical result that **the composition of two functors is a functor**,
    and **the composition of two applicatives is an applicative**.

    Use cases:
    - Combining effects: `Compose IO Option α` represents an IO action that may fail
    - Nested mapping: `map f` on `Compose F G` maps through both layers -/
structure Compose (F : Type u → Type v) (G : Type w → Type u) (α : Type w) where
  /-- Unwrap the composed value: $F\,(G\;\alpha)$. -/
  getCompose : F (G α)

/-- **Identity law** for composed functors: $\text{fmap}\;\text{id} = \text{id}$.

    If $F$ and $G$ are both lawful functors, their composition is also lawful. -/

/-- **Composition law** for composed functors:
    $\text{fmap}\;(f \circ g) = \text{fmap}\;f \circ \text{fmap}\;g$.

    Follows from the composition laws of $F$ and $G$ individually. -/

/-- `Seq` instance for `Compose F G`: applies through both layers using
    the applicative structure of $F$ and $G$.
